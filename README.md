## Introduction

This is a free implementation for an ECS sample.

It's an adaptation of some common framework in GameDev to manage in a more reliable 
way some entities, their living attributes and the System running all those stuff.

This is a Static implementation.

A dynamic implementation (meaning usage of component containers into Entity, will 
come soon).


## Sample code

Checkout the tag 1.0.0.0 will provide a simple implementation of a common java object 
with some attributes and a main process using it.
